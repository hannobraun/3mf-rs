//! # 3MF (3D Manufacturing Format) support for Rust
//!
//! This library provides support for [3MF] files to programs written in the
//! Rust programming language. 3MF is a file format commonly used for 3D
//! printing. It is typically exported from a CAD program, and imported to a
//! slicer.
//!
//! So far, functionality is limited to writing 3MF files, and only the most
//! basic features of 3MF are supported. Adding support for reading 3MF files,
//! and for more features of the 3MF format is very desirable, and any
//! contributions toward that are very welcome.
